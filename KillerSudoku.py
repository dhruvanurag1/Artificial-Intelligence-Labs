#as input you take the {sum of cages: [{indices corresponding to that sum}]}
#generate all the possible ways to get that sum given the number of numbers you have to fill and set those as the variables
#in order to check the solution, you check if both the sudoku rules are true and the sum of the numbers of each of the cages is correct
